/* Shop: - A class that represents a shop in the game. It has an inventory of items that can be bought and sold, and prices for each item.
        - The player can buy items from the shop if they have enough money.
        - Once a user completes a purchase, the listing for that item is updated to say something like 'in kitchen/stock'.
        - Once a user buys an item, they do not need to buy it again. The item is available for use in the kitchen. (Buying = unlocking)
        - Items PC can buy: Ingredients, Recipes, Kitchen Upgrades (Equipment), Biomes

        Notes:
        - Item state: lock/unlock
        - Make a shop scriptable object so UI will just need to reference it
        
        - Shop will have a list of items, each with a name, price, status, icon, and description
        - Separate script for shop functions (buying, adding to player inventory, changing status of items in shop)
